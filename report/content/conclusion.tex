\section{Conclusion}

From the project it can be concluded that for predicting tags from given
Stackoverflow questions, an ensemble of decision trees trained on subsets of
the data can be trained in a parallel, distributed manner, and will obtain a
decent test performance.

It can also be concluded that using an unsupervised approach with K-means
clustering, proper performance can be difficult to obtain and model training
will be slow.
