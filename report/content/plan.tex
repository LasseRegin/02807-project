\section{Future plan}

For the final two weeks of the project I will be working on the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fix memory issue of parallel K-means implementation
  \item Find proper feature-hashing (currently using simple trivial hashing)
  \item Train and evaluate model
  \item Finish the report
\end{itemize}
