\section{Methods}

For modelling the distribution of the post tags an unsupervised approach is used.

The data will be presented using feature-hashing. Each post will be
transformed to a fixed-size feature vector resulting in each post being a point
in a given feature space.

A training set of posts will be clustered into $K$ clusters where $K$ is the
number of distinct tags in the data, resulting in $K$ cluster centroids.

When predicting a given post the tags of the closest $n$ centroids will be
assigned the post.

The cluster algorithm \textit{K-means} will initially be used, and due to the
size of the dataset a normal trivial implementation of the algorithm will not
suffice, hence a parallel version will be implemented.
