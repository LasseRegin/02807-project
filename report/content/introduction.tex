\section{Introduction}

In this project a model predicting tags associating a given text will be
constructed. The problem will be handled as a classification problem, hence
a classifier will be trained.

The classifier will be trained on posts from Stackoverflow where associated
tags have been given.

Initially only the top $20$ frequent tags and posts containing these tags will
be used for training and prediction.

Finally the model will be evaluated using all tags and posts.

During implementation and debugging a subset of the data will be used.
