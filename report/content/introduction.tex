\section{Introduction}

In this project two models predicting tags associating a given text will be
proposed, implemented, and tested. The problem will be handled as a
multi-label classification problem.

The models will be trained on posts from Stackoverflow where associated
tags have been given.

The top $20$ frequent tags and posts containing these tags will be used for
training and prediction.


The first model is an unsupervised model where the distribution of the tags
text types are attempted learned using the K-means clustering algorithm
\cite{numerical-optimization}. By clustering the texts into $20$ clusters each
cluster will (hopefully) represent a given tag. The prediction of tags can
then be done by looking at a given text's closest clusters.


The second model is a supervised model based on Decision Trees
\cite{numerical-optimization}. Inspired by the \textit{Random Forest} ensemble
model an ensemble of decision trees are trained on subsets of the training data,
and thereby resembles the structure of the \textit{Random Forest} model.
Prediction of tags are then based on the mean probabilities predicted by all
decision trees.
